excerpt: As defined in the React documentation, a higher-order component, or HOC, is a function that returns a React component that wraps a specified child component and often provides augmented functionality. Implementing HOCs can be hard when considering hoisting statics, managing ref forwarding, and handling display name. addhoc is a newly released open-source package that aims to handle these challenges for you.

Higher-order components, or HOCs, are a powerful way to add functionality or adjust behavior of arbitrary components.
Indeed, libraries often provide HOCs to augment components with functionality or information.

Take [react-redux], for example: to connect your component to your store, you use the `connect()` HOC. `connect()` wraps
your UI component with a container component that handles passing state between the store and the UI component. Or
[react-router]'s `withRouter` HOC, which injects the router functionality and information into your page components
seamlessly.

## Sounds cool! How do I get in on this?

Glad you asked! The [React docs] explain how you too can build HOCs. But spend some time in that doc and you'll soon
realize that [here there be dragons]. When you build a HOC, you're now on the hook to manage proper communication
between parents and children of the wrapped component.

You must:

- [pass through unrelated `props`]
- [wrap the display name for easy debugging]
- [hoist non-React statics]
- [forward `refs`]

Furthermore, these considerations are interrelated, so you need to make sure to handle them in the right order and
hierarchy.

## Ew, this sounds ugly…

I agree.

You see, recently, I was writing a HOC to provide [React 16 Context API] functionality to components. I read
those docs and hit each of those caveats. I spent a day or two carefully arranging code to handle them elegantly, wrote
thorough tests, and patted myself on the back. Then, I moved onto my next ticket and had to do the same thing for a
different context.

Like any good software engineer, I am lazy. I hate doing the same thing twice. So, I took what I learned from the first
HOC and extracted it into a new open source module.

## Avoid building HOCs ad hoc with `addhoc`

I'm excited to share [`addhoc`], a new open-source module to vastly simplify building _correct_ HOCs. It takes the pain
out of the process so you can focus on the actual value-add you're trying to provide.

`addhoc` creates HOC functions that automatically:

- [pass through unrelated `props`]
- [wrap the display name for easy debugging]
- [hoist non-React statics]
- [forward `refs`]

## Nice, how do I use it?

It's easy. Start by installing `addhoc` as a dependency:

```sh
# --save is default in the latest npm, and thus optional here
npm install [--save] addhoc
```

Then, import `addhoc` in your code and start building HOCs.

`addhoc` is a function that returns a HOC function. To construct your HOC, you pass a callback that acts as the render
function of your top-level component.

Your callback is provided a function parameter that returns the wrapped child that's initially provided to the HOC. You
can call that callback with an object of `props` to add to the wrapped component.

You can also optionally pass in a string name to show when debugging the React component hierarchy.

Let's take a look at some examples to better illustrate how to use it:

### Example 1: Adding a `prop`

Sometimes, you want to add one or more `props` to wrapped components. With `addhoc`, you can make a HOC to do this in
one line of code.

```jsx
import addhoc from 'addhoc';
import MyComponent from './my-component';

// Make the HOC function
const withFooProp = addhoc(getWrappedComponent => getWrappedComponent({ foo: true }), 'WithFooProp');

// Wrap your component using the HOC
const MyComponentWithFoo = withFooProp(MyComponent);

// Rendering a MyComponentWithFoo will create a MyComponent with prop foo = true
// The component hierarchy will look like
//   WithFooProp(MyComponent)
//   └── MyComponent
```

### Example 2: Wrapping in another component

Another common HOC scenario is wrapping one component in another. `addhoc` makes this simple as well.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import addhoc from 'addhoc';
import MyComponent from './my-component';

// Make the HOC function
const withDiv = addhoc(getWrappedComponent =>
  <div>
    { getWrappedComponent() }
  </div>, 'WithDiv');

// Wrap your component using the HOC
const MyComponentWithDiv = withDiv(MyComponent);

// Rendering a MyComponentWithDiv will render a div that wraps a MyComponent
```

### Example 3: React 16 Context consumer

With the [React 16 Context API], consuming a context now requires wrapping components with a Context Consumer node. This
is a great use-case for HOCs as they free consumers of your context from having to deal with the Context directly.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import addhoc from 'addhoc';
import MyComponent from './my-component';

// Create the Context
const MyContext = React.createContext('DefaultValue');

// Make the HOC function
const withMyContext = addhoc(getWrappedComponent =>
  <MyContext.Consumer>
    { value => getWrappedComponent({ value }) }
  </MyContext.Consumer>, 'WithMyContext');

// Wrap your component using the HOC
const MyComponentWithMyContext = withMyContext(MyComponent);

// Now, the MyComponentWithMyContext automatically gets a prop called `value` that gets the context
// value passed in from the context.
render() {
  return <MyContext.Provider value='ProvidedValue'>
    <MyComponentWithMyContext />
  </MyContext.Provider>
}
```

### Example 4: Passing through configuration

Sometimes, you want to set some values as part of assembling the HOC and have those available in your render function.
You can pass arbitrary parameters after the `name` param to `addhoc` and they'll be passed through as additional
parameters to your render function:

```jsx
import addhoc from 'addhoc';
import MyComponent from './my-component';

// Make the HOC function
const withFooProp = addhoc((getWrappedComponent, extra) => getWrappedComponent({ foo: extra }),
  'WithFoo', 'EXTRA');

// Wrap your component using the HOC
const MyComponentWithFoo = withFooProp(MyComponent);

// Rendering a MyComponentWithFoo will get a `foo` prop with value `EXTRA`
```

## Conclusion

With `addhoc`, making higher-order components is easy to do right. It manages the ugly parts for you, allowing you to do
what you do best.

Give [`addhoc`] a try the next time you need to build a HOC and let me know how it went. You can find me on Twitter
[@decompiled] or in the [GoDaddy OpenSource Slack channel][slack]. Have another use case? Contributions are always
welcome.
